Legal bits:
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use DarkRift in your project we ask that you give us credit somewhere in your game, eg. in the credits or 
as a spash screen. We've included 2 images for you to use but feel free for it to be just a simple text reference.

DarkRift is protected by copyright laws. However, we allow you to use, redistribute and modify all files except the
server executable and the .dll Library files. We also reserve the right to change these legal terms at any point 
without notice.

We need to make money out of this, pirating things isn't nice :)
